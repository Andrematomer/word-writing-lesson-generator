# Word Writing Lesson Generator ✏️

Traditional alphabet practice can often feel like a chore for toddlers. Many children are hesitant to learn their ABCs through repetitive rote memorization and find generic worksheets uninspiring.

**This tool was built on a simple insight:** Children are much more excited to write when the words mean something to them. Whether it’s their own name, their favorite animal, or a toy they love, writing words they have a personal interest in boosts their mood and turns "study time" into "play time."

## ✨ Features
- **Interest-Led Learning:** Type any word that excites your child to generate an instant, personalized lesson.
- **Stroke Order Guidance:** Every letter block includes visual cues and numbered arrows to help children master the correct writing sequence and direction.
- **Full Case Support:** Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Multi-page Support:** Enter a list of favorite words (one per line) to create a custom workbook.
- **Smart Layout:** Choose between equal spacing or optimized spacing. The tool automatically protects letters with "tails" (g, j, p, q, y) so they never get cut off.
- **Vector Quality:** By hosting on GitHub Pages, this tool uses SVG injection to ensure your "Save as PDF" results are 100% sharp, professional-grade vectors.
