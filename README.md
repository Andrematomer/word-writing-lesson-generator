# Word Writing Lesson Generator ✏️

Traditional alphabet practice can often feel like a chore for toddlers. Many children are hesitant to learn their ABCs through repetitive rote memorization and find generic worksheets uninspiring.

**This tool was built on a simple insight:** Children are much more excited to write when the words mean something to them. Whether it’s their own name, their favorite animal, or a toy they love, writing words they have a personal interest in boosts their mood and turns "study time" into "play time."

## ✨ Features
- **Interest-Led Learning:** Type any word that excites your child to generate an instant, personalized lesson.
- **Stroke Order Guidance:** Every letter block includes visual cues and numbered arrows to help children master the correct writing sequence and direction.
- **Full Case Support:** Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Multi-page Support:** Enter a list of favorite words (one per line) to create a custom workbook.
- **Smart Layout:** Choose between equal spacing or optimized spacing. The tool automatically protects letters with "tails" (g, j, p, q, y) so they never get cut off.
- **Vector Quality:** By hosting on GitHub Pages, this tool uses SVG injection to ensure your "Save as PDF" results are 100% sharp, professional-grade vectors.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Visit the live tool: [pending]
2. Type words your child loves in the text area (e.g., "Truck", "Dinosaur", "Pizza").
3. Choose your preferred block distribution.
4. Click **Print / Save as PDF**.
5. **Tip:** In the print dialog, uncheck "Headers and Footers" for a perfectly clean worksheet.

## 🛠 Setup & Technical Info
This is a "Vanilla JS" web application with zero dependencies.
- **Offline Note:** This tool uses `fetch()` to ensure vector-perfect PDF quality. Because of browser security rules, it must be hosted (e.g., GitHub Pages) or run via a local server to function.
- **Filenames:** Uses a compact ideographic naming convention:
  - `大_` prefix for Uppercase (Big).
  - `小_` prefix for Lowercase (Small).
